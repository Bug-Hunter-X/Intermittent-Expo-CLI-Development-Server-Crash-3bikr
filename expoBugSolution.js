The solution involves several steps to address potential causes of the server crash and improve debugging.

1. **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU and memory usage while running the Expo development server.  High resource consumption could indicate a memory leak or other performance bottleneck. Consider using system monitoring tools to track these metrics.

2. **Enhanced Logging:** Add detailed logging statements to your app and potentially even to the Expo CLI's internal processes (if feasible). This increased logging can provide more clues about the conditions leading to the crash. 

3. **Simplify the App:** Temporarily remove less critical components or features from your application to isolate potential sources of problems. By running a simplified version of the app, you may be able to pinpoint the part that's causing the issue.

4. **Check Dependencies:** Make sure all of your dependencies are up to date and compatible with each other.  Outdated libraries or conflicting versions can sometimes lead to unpredictable behavior.

5. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes a clean build can resolve unusual problems. Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.

6. **Expo CLI Update:** Make sure you have the latest version of Expo CLI installed. Run `npm install -g expo-cli` to update.

7. **Different Port:** Try running the Expo server on a different port, in case there's a port conflict.

Example Logging (Add to your app's components):
```javascript
console.log('Entering component:', componentName);
console.log('State:', this.state);
```
Implementing these steps provides a more systematic approach to troubleshooting and identifying the root cause of the unpredictable Expo CLI server crashes.
