While developing a React Native app using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would intermittently crash without any clear error messages in the console.  The app would build successfully, but upon attempting to run it with `expo start`, the server would terminate unexpectedly, leaving me with no debugging information. This happened inconsistently, making it difficult to reproduce and troubleshoot.
