# Intermittent Expo CLI Development Server Crash

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using Expo CLI, where the development server crashes intermittently without providing any helpful error messages.  The app itself builds without issues, but the server unexpectedly terminates when starting with `expo start`.

The issue is inconsistent and difficult to reproduce reliably.  The provided solution attempts to address potential causes and improve debugging capabilities.

**Bug:**
The development server crashes unexpectedly, usually without clear error messages, making troubleshooting very challenging. The app itself may function correctly, but the development environment becomes unusable.

**Solution:**
The solution focuses on strategies to identify potential causes, including checking for resource exhaustion and adding more detailed logging to help pinpoint the issue.
